# CryptoCurrency-Price-Prediction



This project aims to predict the future prices of cryptocurrencies using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models. This Read Me file will provide an overview of the project, its requirements, and instructions for running the code.

# Project Overview
Cryptocurrencies have gained significant popularity in recent years, and many traders and investors are interested in predicting their future prices. LSTM and RNN are powerful deep learning models that can capture long-term dependencies and patterns in sequential data, making them suitable for cryptocurrency price prediction.

In this project, historical cryptocurrency price data will be used to train LSTM and RNN models. These models will then be used to make predictions on unseen data, enabling us to forecast future cryptocurrency prices.

# Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following:

1.Python (version 3.6 or above)
2.TensorFlow (version 2.x)
3.Keras (version 2.x)
4.Numpy
5.Pandas
6.Matplotlib
